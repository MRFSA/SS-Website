<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The <em>Saratoga Spectacular</em> is an event run by the Mackenzie River Fish Stocking Association (MRFSA), a non-profit organisation run by volunteer members.</p>
<h2>Access to Information</h2>
A small number of MRFSA members require access to the information you provide to us (i.e. the information you give us in your Nomination forms) in order to complete certain duties and services. For example: completing your competition nomination, or letting you know about other upcoming events run by the MRFSA. Only a limited number of members have access to this information, only where required by their position and permission granted by the MRFSA.</p>

If you do not feel comfortable providing any of these details to us (except for your Name and Category), you are free to withold them from your nomination form. Note that in certain cases this may limit your chances for certain prizes/draws made available at the competition.</p>
<h2>How we use your Information</h2>
<p>We only use your information for the duration of the competition in which you have nominated, and for mailouts for up to 12 months after the competition has ended. Mailouts are usually made by email, and are always limited to MRFSA-run events, like the next Saratoga Spectacular or a Fish Release at the Bedford Weir.</p>

<strong>Your Name</strong> Announced at lucky draws, if your nomination number is drawn for a prize<br />

<strong>Gender</strong> occasionally the MRFSA will have gender-specific category prizes. you don't have to provide this information but you won't be eligible for such categories<br />
<p>We won't publish your information, except for your name and town of origin - where you have won the major prize or placed in a fish category at the competition</p>
<p>You may ask us to retract your information on request, which we will do as far as reasonably practicable.</p>
<h2>Internal Access to Information</h2>
<p>As stated earlier, only a limited number of members are given access to information, and can only access the information which they are required to access as part of their position. As members are not formally employed by MRFSA and most do not have offcial 'positions', these positions (and the level of access granted) are decided by the MRFSA</p>
<p>All parties/personnel with any access to your information must at all times adhere to the <em>Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cwth)</em> and any other Commonwealth or Queensland government legislation.</p>
<p>You may request access to your own personal information by contacting the MRFSA, providing you can sufficiently provide evidence of your identity</p>
